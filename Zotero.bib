This hybrid model, which integrates sky imaging techniques, support vector machine and artificial neural network sub-models, is developed using one year of co-located, high-quality irradiance and sky image recording in Folsom, California. We validate the proposed model using six-month of measured irradiance and sky image data, and apply it to construct operational PI forecasts in real-time at the same observatory. In the real-time scenario, the hybrid model significantly outperforms the reference persistence model and provides high performance PIs regardless of forecast horizon and weather condition.},

	abstract = {Summary.  We propose a methodology to sample sequentially from a sequence of probability distributions that are defined on a common space, each distribution being known up to a normalizing constant. These probability distributions are approximated by a cloud of weighted random samples which are propagated over time by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This methodology allows us to derive simple algorithms to make parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms interact to perform global optimization and sequential Bayesian estimation and to compute ratios of normalizing constants. We illustrate these algorithms for various integration tasks arising in the context of Bayesian inference.},

	abstract = {Many modern statistical applications involve inference for complex stochastic models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

	abstract = {Recent decades have seen enormous improvements in computational inference for statistical models; there have been competitive continual enhancements in a wide range of computational tools. In Bayesian inference, first and foremost, MCMC techniques have continued to evolve, moving from random walk proposals to Langevin drift, to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and so on, with both theoretical and algorithmic innovations opening new opportunities to practitioners. However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difficulties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects. Approximate models and algorithms may thus be at the core of the next computational revolution.},

	abstract = {Objectives Evaluating the variation in the strength of the effect across studies is a key feature of meta-analyses. This variability is reflected by measures like τ2 or I2, but their clinical interpretation is not straightforward. A prediction interval is less complicated: it presents the expected range of true effects in similar studies. We aimed to show the advantages of having the prediction interval routinely reported in meta-analyses.
Design We show how the prediction interval can help understand the uncertainty about whether an intervention works or not. To evaluate the implications of using this interval to interpret the results, we selected the first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issues 2009–2013 with a dichotomous (n=2009) or continuous (n=1254) outcome, and generated 95\% prediction intervals for them.
Results In 72.4\% of 479 statistically significant (random-effects p{\textless}0.05) meta-analyses in the Cochrane Database 2009–2013 with heterogeneity (I2{\textgreater}0), the 95\% prediction interval suggested that the intervention effect could be null or even be in the opposite direction. In 20.3\% of those 479 meta-analyses, the prediction interval showed that the effect could be completely opposite to the point estimate of the meta-analysis. We demonstrate also how the prediction interval can be used to calculate the probability that a new trial will show a negative effect and to improve the calculations of the power of a new trial.
Conclusions The prediction interval reflects the variation in treatment effects over different settings, including what effect is to be expected in future patients, such as the patients that a clinician is interested to treat. Prediction intervals should be routinely reported to allow more informative inferences in meta-analyses.},

As more processes and model parameters are added, a comprehensive model calibration with process-level data becomes costly and predictions of such complex models are therefore often restricted to local applications. In this context, inverse modelling techniques enable to calibrate models with data of the same type than model outputs (thereafter called population data for the sake of clarity, although other data types can be used according to model outputs), which are usually simpler to collect and more readily available. This study aims at demonstrating how such data can be used to improve ecological models, by recalibrating the most influential parameters of a complex model in a Bayesian framework, and at providing general guidelines for potential users of this approach. We used the individual-based and spatially explicit forest dynamics simulation model Samsara2 as a case study. Considering the results of an initial calibration and of a sensitivity analysis as prerequisites, we assessed whether we could use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to recalibrate a subset of parameters on historical management data collected in forests with various ecological conditions. We propose guidelines to answer three questions that potential users of the approach will encounter: (1) How many and which parameters are we able to recalibrate accurately with such low-informative data? (2) How many ABC simulations are required to obtain a reasonable convergence of the parameter posterior estimates? (3) What is the variability of model predictions following the recalibration? In our case study, we found that two parameters by species could be recalibrated with forest management data and that a relatively low number of simulations (20,000) was sufficient. We finally pointed out that the variability of model predictions was largely due to model stochasticity, and much less to ABC recalibration and initial calibration uncertainties. Combining direct process-level calibration to ABC recalibration of the most influential parameters opens the door to interesting modelling improvements, such as the calibration of forest dynamics along environmental gradients. This general approach should thus help improve both accuracy and generality of model-based ecological predictions.},

However, for many complex probability models, such likelihoods are either impossible or computationally prohibitive to obtain. Here we present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for generating observations from a posterior distribution without the use of likelihoods. It can also be used in frequentist applications, in particular for maximum-likelihood estimation. The approach is illustrated by an example of ancestral inference in population genetics. A number of open problems are highlighted in the discussion.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation has become an essential tool for the analysis of complex stochastic models when the likelihood function is numerically unavailable. However, the well-established statistical method of empirical likelihood provides another route to such settings that bypasses simulations from the model and the choices of the approximate Bayesian computation parameters (summary statistics, distance, tolerance), while being convergent in the number of observations. Furthermore, bypassing model simulations may lead to significant time savings in complex models, for instance those found in population genetics. The Bayesian computation with empirical likelihood algorithm we develop in this paper also provides an evaluation of its own performance through an associated effective sample size. The method is illustrated using several examples, including estimation of standard distributions, time series, and population genetics models.},

	abstract = {Airline turnaround time is defined as the time required to unload an airplane after its arrival at the gate and to prepare it for departure again. In today’s era of exorbitant airport charges and rising fuel charges levied across the world, it becomes important for airline companies to come out with ways to cut back cost. Since there is very little control over fuel costs, one of the ways airline companies can cut back cost without compromising quality is by reducing Turnaround Time. In order to cut costs and increase performance, airlines work constantly on reducing turnaround time as these smaller and larger adaptations can be seen as important process innovations, and they are crucial for competitiveness. In the absence of such measures, some companies find themselves in situations wherein they end up with very low profits or very high losses. Airline Turnaround Time has hence become a very important and key parameter in determining the profitability of an airline company. Such situations can lead to a lot of undesirable consequences, as it has a direct impact on the survival of the organization due to a series of payment crisis one after another. This case study tries to explain the application of process of ongoing improvement, the basic approach of Theory of Constraint to improve turnaround time.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of modern climate system simulators is controlled by numerous parameters. By matching model outputs with observed data we can perform inference on such parameters. This is a calibration problem that usually requires the ability to evaluate the computer code at any given configuration of the parameters. As the climate system simulator attempts to describe very complex physical phenomena, the task of running the model is very computationally demanding. Thus, a statistical model is required to approximate the model output. In this work, we use output from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology two-dimensional climate model (MIT2DCM), historical records and output from a three-dimensional climate model, to obtain estimates of the climate sensitivity, the effective thermal diffusivity in the deep ocean and the net aerosol forcing that control MIT2DCM. We use a Bayesian approach that allows for the use of scientifically based information on the climate parameters to be used in the calibration process. The model tackles the problem of dealing with multivariate computer model output and incorporates all estimation uncertainties into the posterior distributions of the climate parameters. Additionally we obtain estimates of the correlation structure of the unforced variability of temperature change patterns. These results are critical for understanding uncertainty in future climate change and provide an independent check that the information that is contained in recent climate change is robust to statistical treatment. These results include uncertainties in the estimation of the multivariate covariance matrices.},

  abstract = {Recent new methods in Bayesian simulation have provided ways of evaluating posterior distributions in the presence of analytically or computationally intractable likelihood functions. Despite representing a substantial methodological advance, existing methods based on rejection sampling or Markov chain Monte Carlo can be highly inefficient and accordingly require far more iterations than may be practical to implement. Here we propose a sequential Monte Carlo sampler that convincingly overcomes these inefficiencies. We demonstrate its implementation through an epidemiological study of the transmission rate of tuberculosis.},

	abstract = {This tutorial explains the foundation of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an approach to Bayesian inference that does not require the specification of a likelihood function, and hence that can be used to estimate posterior distributions of parameters for simulation-based models. We discuss briefly the philosophy of Bayesian inference and then present several algorithms for ABC. We then apply these algorithms in a number of examples. For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from ABC to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory (REM) for which the true posteriors are unknown. We conclude with a number of recommendations for applying ABC methods to solve real-world problems.},

Equations for multiplexer and de-multiplexer elements are presented, which allows to simulate not only tandem but queueing networks with an arbitrary topology. Time savings obtained with FDES could speed up the analyses of large-scale queueing network systems. Experimental results show that FDES modeling can be two orders of magnitude faster than their counterparts based on the event-scheduling for practical cases.},
